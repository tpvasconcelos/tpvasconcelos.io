## ridgeplot

I am the author and maintainer of [**ridgeplot^155:octicons-star-fill-16:^**](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot), a Python package that provides a simple interface for plotting beautiful and interactive [ridgeline plots](https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/getting_started.html) within the extensive [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) ecosystem. 

So far, the project has had up to [102k downloads](https://pypistats.org/packages/ridgeplot) in a month on PyPI, is used by [over 140](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/network/dependents?dependent_type=REPOSITORY) public GitHub repositories, and is a dependency of notable projects such as [**Shiny for Python^1.3k:octicons-star-fill-16:^**](https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny), [**Ploomber^3.5k:octicons-star-fill-16:^**](https://github.com/ploomber), and [**NiMARE^182:octicons-star-fill-16:^**](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE). 

While maintaining this library, I have implemented [feature](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/issues/77) [requests](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/issues/152), [answered](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/discussions/213) [questions](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/discussions/214), and solved [bug](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/issues/1) [reports](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/issues/197). The project tries to follow Python best practices, has a comprehensive [user guide](https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html) and [API documentation](https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html), strict linting rules and type checks, high [test coverage](https://app.codecov.io/gh/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot) for both functional and unit tests, and robust CI/CD workflows.

## Contributions to other projects

I try to actively contribute to open-source projects in the Python and scientific computing ecosystems, with [significant](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/5630) [contributions](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/pull/2423) to high-profile projects such as [**sktime^8k:octicons-star-fill-16:^**](https://github.com/sktime/sktime) and [**Feast^5.6k:octicons-star-fill-16:^**](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast) and [smaller](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33185) [contributions](https://github.com/unionai-oss/pandera/issues/834) to projects like [**Apache Spark^40k:octicons-star-fill-16:^**](https://github.com/apache/spark) and [**pandera^3.4k:octicons-star-fill-16:^**](https://github.com/unionai-oss/pandera).

My contributions span from [identifying](https://github.com/vacanza/holidays/issues/1559) and [fixing](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/5853) critical [bugs](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/pull/6738), to implementing substantial improvements like [speeding-up checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/issues/6740) by up to 70%. Beyond code contributions, I also [participate](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast/pull/2517) in the open-source community through [code](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/5592#issuecomment-1857745836) [reviews](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pull/5834), [helping users](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/3214#issuecomment-1335569791) [troubleshoot issues](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/429#issuecomment-754972771), and providing [context](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/51012#issuecomment-1743856513) and [feedback](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3407#issuecomment-1410161309) where needed.

## Smaller projects
