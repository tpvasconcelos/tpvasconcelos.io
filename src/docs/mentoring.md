# Mentoring


I've been very fortunate to have had great mentors throughout my academic and professional career. And I am
well aware of the significant impact these individuals have had on getting me to where I am today.

Having worked in the industry for over half a decade now -- from machine learning engineer to solutions
architect, data engineer, or data scientist… -- I have worn many hats while helping teams and companies
deliver value-driven solutions to predictive analytics and data science problems. Currently, I'm working with
[Nike](https://www.nike.com/) as a Machine Learning Engineer, where I develop, evaluate, and improve
statistical models for long-term forecasting
and [demand sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_sensing) of Nike’s future consumer demand.

I believe I'm well-equipped to help you navigate the challenges of a new job, understand the technical and
non-technical aspects of a new role, help you achieve your goals, provide you with relevant feedback in
critical areas, and help you grow as a good all-around professional. Be it in the form of casual chats, or
more structured mentoring sessions, I would be happy to help you out.

If you have a specific question or just want to say hi, feel free
to [drop me an e-mail](mailto:hello@tpvasconcelos.com)
or [connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tpvasconcelos/). For more structured mentoring sessions, 
I recommend you check out
my [MentorCruise profile](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/tomaspereiradevasconcelos/). Here, you will be able
to book a session with me for things like CV reviews, interview prep, code reviews, and more.
