## Publications

- _**“The second virial coefficient of bounded Mie potentials”**_ - The Journal of Chemical Physics 147, 214504 (2017) [https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5006035](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5006035)

    This work is concerned with, for the first time, the derivation of analytic expressions for the second virial coefficient of bounded Mie potentials. The convergence properties of the series expansions were also considered, as well as considerations of parameters that give rise to thermodynamic stability.

## BSc Physics Thesis

**Classification:** First Class - 82%

My research efforts were focused on a "bounded potential model" commonly used to describe the interaction between particles in colloid and polymer systems. I successfully derived the solution to the_second virial coefficient_ of this bounded potential as a series expansion in terms of orthogonal polynomials, which was the primary goal of the project.

I have received excellent feedback from my supervisor and the evaluation panel regarding my performance, enthusiasm, and initiative. Maybe more importantly, this project has allowed me to make my first original contribution to science. The work done on this thesis was expanded on a collaboration with Professor David M Heyes, and the results [published](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5006035) in [The Journal of Chemical Physics](https://aip.scitation.org/journal/jcp).

**Official feedback from the thesis evaluation panel:**

- _“His overall performance was in the excellent category.”_
- _“Tomas observed and brought out […] a number of very interesting results, of a caliber which would reflect well on a researcher of many more years experience.”_
- _“The series expansion and MD modeling aspects of the project were definite steps forward in our understanding of the behavior of this system."_
- _“[Tomas] derived single-handedly a series expansion in terms of orthogonal polynomials, which is a new approach as far as I am aware.”_

    Shared the results and findings of a project that aimed to forecast the carpark availability in major UK cities. The project started as a collaboration between South East Physics Network, Royal Holloway University of London, and Accelogress Ltd. I [continued](/about/professional-experience/#accelogress-1yr-10mos) working on this project as an independent contractor for Accelogress Ltd.
