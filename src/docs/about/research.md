    This work is concerned with, for the first time, the derivation of
    analytic expressions in the form of series expansions for the second
    virial coefficient of bounded Mie potentials. This generalization of
    the Mie potential allows for potential functions which are finite
    at the origin (_"bounded"_). We also investigate the convergence
    properties of the series expansions and considerations of
    parameters which give rise to thermodynamic stability.

My research efforts were focused on a "bounded potential model" commonly
used to describe the interaction between particles in colloid and
polymer systems. I successfully derived the solution to the
_second virial coefficient_ of this bounded potential as a series
expansion in terms of orthogonal polynomials, which was the primary goal
of the project.

I have received excellent feedback from my supervisor and the project
markers regarding my performance, enthusiasm, and initiative.
Additionally, and maybe more importantly, this project has allowed me
to make my first original contribution to science and reinforced my
interest and commitment to pursue a career in scientific research.
The work done on this thesis was expanded on a collaboration with
Professor David M Heyes, and the results
[published](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5006035) in
[The Journal of Chemical Physics](https://aip.scitation.org/journal/jcp).


**Official written-comments from the thesis supervisor and markers:**

> “His overall performance was in the excellent category.”

> “Tomas observed and brought out […] a number of very interesting
results, of a caliber which would reflect well on a researcher of many
more years experience.”

> “The series expansion and MD modeling aspects of the project were
definite steps forward in our understanding of the behavior
of this system."

> “[Tomas] derived single-handedly a series expansion in terms of
orthogonal polynomials, which is a new approach as far as I am aware.”
