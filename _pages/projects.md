**⚠️ Probably not up-tp-date...**

- **[mdsea](https://github.com/TPVasconcelos/mdsea)** -
    `mdsea` is a stand-alone Python molecular dynamics library equipped
    with a flexible simulation engine and multiple analysis tools,
    including integrated beautiful visualization in 1, 2, and 3
    dimensions. Head over to [mdsea's repo](https://github.com/TPVasconcelos/mdsea)
    to check out some of the examples and learn more about my project.

- **[tomasvasconcelos.com](http://tomasvasconcelos.com/)** -
    I design, develop, and maintain my personal webpage (this one!).
    It's a static website powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)'s
    framework and configured with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is
    hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the
    [source](https://github.com/TPVasconcelos/tpvasconcelos.io) is
    openly available.

- **[JekyllMedium](https://github.com/TPVasconcelos/JekyllMedium)** -
    Starting from [Jekyll Now](https://www.jekyllnow.com), I designed
    this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme as an attempt to emulate
    the clean look of [Medium](https://medium.com)'s blog platform.
    Have a look at the
    [live demo](https://tpvasconcelos.github.io/JekyllMedium/) now!


- **[desa·fios](http://desa-fios.com)** -
    Designed and developed the website and online portfolio for desa·fios,
    an independent jewelry artist based in Estoril, Portugal.
    Temporarily down!


- **[BoxParti](https://github.com/TPVasconcelos/BoxParti)** -
    This was my first ever programming project, developed for a
    "Scientific Computing Skills" module in University. It is a
    Python GUI application that runs simple molecular dynamics simulations.
    I've since expanded this into
    [mdsea](https://github.com/TPVasconcelos/mdsea).
